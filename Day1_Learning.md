\# AI Voice Agents Challenge | Day 1 – Starter Voice Agent



\## ✅ Task Completed



\- Successfully set up the \*\*frontend\*\* (React/Next.js) and \*\*backend\*\* (LiveKit + Murf Falcon TTS)  

\- Configured environment variables and tested real-time voice interaction  

\- Ran the voice agent locally and verified smooth conversation between frontend and backend  

\- Backend STT (Deepgram) and TTS (Murf Falcon) integration working perfectly  



\## 🎯 Learning Outcomes



\- Learned to integrate \*\*Murf Falcon TTS\*\* for ultra-fast, high-quality speech synthesis  

\- Understood how \*\*LiveKit Agents\*\* handle real-time voice streaming and participant tokens  

\- Explored STT integration using \*\*Deepgram API\*\* for accurate transcription  

\- Got hands-on experience running a monorepo with both backend and frontend  



\## 📝 Observations



\- The voice agent responds to user queries in real-time  

\- Audio quality is clear with minimal latency  

\- Environment variable management is critical for connecting frontend and backend  

\- Backend logs provide detailed metrics on TTS/STT performance  



\## 🔗 Demo



\- Frontend running locally: `http://localhost:3000`  

\- Backend running locally with logs visible in console  

\- Ready to share a short video demonstrating the voice agent in action
